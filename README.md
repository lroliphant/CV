## Lucy Oliphant

I am both technical and visual - a developer with an appreciation for excellent design and usable interfaces. Having worked in e-commerce on the client-side for a number of years, my primary goal in joining Makers Academy was to gain a better understanding of the server-side of web programming and to try my hand at building end to end web applications. I want to move from web content management into a more traditional front-end developer role in an agile environment. I am looking for the opportunity to work on diverse projects with driven individuals in a company that fosters a culture of learning, openness and collaboration.




## Skills

#### HTML & CSS

* Hand-coding well-structured HTML, using considered semantic elements
* CSS written by hand, built for responsive layouts and mobile devices
* I am also familiar with Sass and the Twitter Bootstrap toolkit
* I have experience using media queries to tailor content to a range of devices. As part of the Selfridges digital team, I worked on the migration and reworking of content into responsive templates for the site redesign project in October 2014, under considerable time pressures. When building web apps/pages I utilise the responsive design principles I have learnt over the years to make content that scales and adapts to offer a great experience irrespective of browser or device
* As approaches to writing, processing and maintaining CSS change, I read relevant blogs to keep up-to-date on advances in the field
* I am aware of the importance of performance and use image optimisation and minification to help deliver fast, efficient applications to users
* Examples of some pages I built for Selfridges.com can be found below.
  * [The Wonder Room landing page](http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/cat/wonder-room/)
  * [Selfridges Loves feature template](http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/content/article/selfridges-loves-agender)
  * [Agender Debate feature](http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/content/article/agender-debate)
  * [Work It: Makerversity](http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/content/work-it-makerversity)


#### JavaScript, jQuery and JavaScript frameworks

Having created various applications using different technologies with JavaScript, it has become clearer to me what a versatile and valuable language it is.

- Single-page applications (SPAs) are an interesting and useful feature of the modern Web - using AngularJS I created a SPA in the form of a To Do list. One of the great features of the AngularJS framework is that it is designed to be highly testable, so I used Karma and Protractor to test drive the build of this SPA - [To do list](https://github.com/lroliphant/todo_challenge)
- [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/lroliphant/rock_paper_scissors_js) - game built in JavaScript and tested with Jasmine, using Express to simplify the process of creating a Node.js server


#### Debugging

- I have a great deal of experience developing solutions to overcome cross-browser issues - after years of wrestling with inconsistent browser behaviour during daily QA at both Mr Porter and Selfridges
- At Selfridges I built a number of different templates for HTML email newsletters using Email on Acid to troubleshoot rendering issues across a wide variety of email clients, devices and operating systems
