## Lucy Oliphant

I am both technical and visual - a developer with an appreciation for excellent design and usable interfaces. Having worked in e-commerce on the client-side for a number of years, my primary goal in joining Makers was gain a better understanding of the server side of web programming and to try my hand at building web applications from the concept stage right through to the finished product. By improving my understanding of the entire application, I also hoped become more agile and efficient within a development team. I want to continue building on my previous experience and everything I have learnt over the past few months at Makers, to move from web content management into a more traditional front-end developer role in an agile environment. I am looking for the opportunity to work on diverse projects with driven individuals in a company that fosters a culture of learning, openness and collaboration.




## Skills

#### HTML & CSS

* Hand-coding well-structured HTML, using considered semantic elements
* CSS written by hand, built for responsive layouts and mobile devices
* I am also familiar with Twitter Bootstrap toolkit and Sass
* I have experience using media queries to tailor content to a range of devices. As part of the Selfridges digital team, I worked on the migration and reworking of content into responsive templates for the site redesign project in October 2014, under considerable time pressures. When building web apps/pages I utilise the responsive design principles I have learnt over the years to make content that scales and adapts to offer a great experience irrespective of browser or device
* As approaches to writing, processing and maintaining CSS change, I read relevant blogs to keep up-to-date on advances in the field
* I am aware of the importance of performance and use image optimisation and minification to help deliver fast, efficient applications to users
* Examples of some pages I built for Selfridges.com can be found below.
  * [The Wonder Room landing page](http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/cat/wonder-room/)
  * [Selfridges Loves feature template](http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/content/article/selfridges-loves-agender)
  * [Agender Debate feature](http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/content/article/agender-debate)
  * [Work It: Makerversity](http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/content/work-it-makerversity)


#### JavaScript, jQuery and JavaScript frameworks

Having created various applications using different technologies with JavaScript, it has become clearer to me what a versatile and valuable language it is.

- Single-page applications (SPAs) are an interesting and useful feature of the modern Web - using AngularJS I created a To Do list. One of the great features of the AngularJS framework is that it is designed to be highly testable, using Karma and Protractor to test drive the build of this SPA - [To do list](https://github.com/lroliphant/todo_challenge)
- [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/lroliphant/rps-js2) - game built in JavaScript and tested with Jasmine, using Express to simplify the process of creating a Node.js server


#### Debugging

- I have a great deal of experience developing solutions to overcome cross-browser issues - after years of wrestling with inconsistent browser behaviour during daily QA at both Mr Porter and Selfridges
- At Selfridges I built a number of different templates for HTML email newsletters using Email on Acid to troubleshoot rendering issues across a wide variety of email clients, devices and operating systems
